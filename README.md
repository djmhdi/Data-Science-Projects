# Data-Science-Projects
### Repository of all data science projects I have worked on.
#### These include analyses that were part of the Galvanize DSI program as well as subsequent pet projects.

* #### Individual Capstone Project
* #### Case Studies - Group Exercises using real-world datasets
* #### Machine Learning on Freely Available Dataset
* #### Other Projects

## 1. Capstone Project
* #### Creating a Gene Network without prior knowledge of biology.  Details can be found [here.](https://github.com/pineda-vv/Creating-gene-networks-using-NLP)

## 2. Case Studies/Group Projects
* #### Creating a Linear Regression model to predict future sales at a farm equipment auction house.  Learned the elements of CRISP-DM and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* #### Churn prediction for users who downloaded the app for a ride-share company.  The exercise involved a lot of EDA, feature engineering, and creating the proper labels for each user.  Optimized and cross-validated a gradient boosting classifier model, using the model's precision and recall as performance indicators.  
* #### Recommender system - movie recommender built using collaborative filtering.  This involved implementing solutions for the cold start problem as well as dealing with the sparsity of the dataset.
* #### Fraud detection system - built a classifier model to detect fraud in real time for an e-commerce company that provided event staging/ticketing.  Built a robust model and set appropriate probability thresholds to flag possible fraud and created actionable items as a response.

## 3. Recipe Recommender
* #### In progress -- details can be found [here](https://github.com/pineda-vv/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/recipe_project)
