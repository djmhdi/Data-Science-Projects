# Recipe Project - in progress
## Business Question
### What information can I extract from the popularity of recipes posted on the food52 website. Can a recipe recommender system be built with just the popularity/rating of each recipe without explicit user ratings?
---
## Data Understanding
### Data scraped from the food52 website - focusing primarily on recipes for dishes that either contain pork, chicken, beef or is vegetarian.  Scraped weblinks using those search terms and extracted the recipe titles, #likes, recipe ingredients from each link.
