# Recipe Project - in progress
## Business Question
### What information can I extract from the popularity of recipes posted on the food52 website. Can a recipe recommender system be built with just the popularity/rating of each recipe without explicit user ratings?
---
## Data Understanding
### Data scraped from the food52 website - focusing primarily on recipes for dishes that either contain "pork", "chicken", "beef" or is "vegetarian".  Collected weblinks using those search terms and then used those links to extract the recipe titles, #likes, recipe ingredients from individual recipe pages.
